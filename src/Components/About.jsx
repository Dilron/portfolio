                Outside of my work life, my activities focus around my family,
                my friends, and my hobbies. Spending time with those close to me
                most commonly involves trying new foods and enjoying as many movies,
                plays, and concerts as possible. After that, my hobbies involve any
                and all things nerdy. Videogames, Boardgames, Tabletop RPGs, and
                Tabletop Wargames all fall under the purview of my interests. I
                would even credit some of my enthusiasm for coding to that fact. Learning
                and manipulating interlocking sets of rules is something I've engaged
                in for as long as I've been able to play games and I hope to bring
                that practice to bear in my work.
